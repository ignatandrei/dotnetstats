What I have learned by building .NET Stars -part 3-  Aspire

I have that same idea to build a project : is what is called today a Modular Monolith - and it is very old in .NET world as can be implemented as a .sln solution.

So we have the interfaces for data/ data flow / , we have a database to store data , an WebAPI to transfer data and  an UI ( Blazor for me) to see the data.

Aspire make it easy to coordinate all this  -by starting the App Host that have all the projects. 

More, Aspire let me coordinate another project to save the data on Blazor - but this will be discussed later . 

I have had just 2  modifications to make it work flawlessly  :

1.   Blazor 

To know the address of the WebAPI to obtain the data  ( once published, Blazor will be near the WebAPI in the wwwroot, but until then it needs the adress )

Blazor can have the configuration stored in a appsettings.json in the wwwroot - but how to write ? I developed an extension for ASPIRE in order to write the data


2. Database

In order to have the database with data , I need to write scripts for create table / insert the data. 

This code shows how
[code lang='csharp']
var paramPass = builder.AddParameter("password", "P@ssw0rd");

var sqlserver = builder.AddSqlServer("sqlserver",paramPass,1433)
    //.WithArgs("pwd","&","ls")
    // Mount the init scripts directory into the container.
    .WithBindMount("./sqlserverconfig", "/usr/config")
    // Mount the SQL scripts directory into the container so that the init scripts run.
    .WithBindMount("../../Scripts/data/sqlserver", "/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d")
    // Run the custom entrypoint script on startup.
    .WithEntrypoint("/usr/config/entrypoint.sh")
    // Configure the container to store data in a volume so that it persists across instances.
    .WithDataVolume() 
    // Keep the container running between app host sessions.
    .WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent)

    ;
var db= sqlserver.AddDatabase("DotNetStats");

[/code]

Also , I have an .gitattributes that contains
[code]
* text=auto
*.sh text eol=lf
*.mod text eol=lf
*.sum text eol=lf
[/code]

in order for the .sh files to maintain linux ending.
