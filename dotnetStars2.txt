What I have learned by building .NET Stars -part 2-  interfaces


I have started the project with interfaces . 

Those are useful because one can see 

- data 
- how to obtain and exchange data
- the application flow 

Thinking in interfaces its hard first, but pays a lot later 

And it pays also fast- with the help of NullObjectPattern from interface ( https://www.nuget.org/packages/rscg_Interface_to_null_object ) , I was capable of seeing the flow of the application - even if does nothing

Another quick win was that we can have many implementations for 

[code lang='csharp']
[ToNullObject]
public interface IStatsData
{
    //other code
IAsyncEnumerable<IProject> RefreshProjects();
}

[ToNullObject]
public interface IProjectsData
{
    IAsyncEnumerable<IProject> GetProjectsAsync();
    Task<bool> SaveProjects(IProject[] projects);

}

[/code]

So I can grab projects from multiple sources ( https://dotnetfoundation.org/ ,  https://github.com/quozd/awesome-dotnet/  , https://github.com/thangchung/awesome-dotnet-core)
implementing IStatsData  and then saving the data by having just one implementation with IProjectsData


You can see the project  at https://ignatandrei.github.io/dotnetstats/ and the source code at http://github.com/ignatandrei/dotnetstats/
